# Overview
Project 4 for Software Quality and Testing course. Use GitHub actions for Continuous Integration and reporting test coverage as a status badge.

## About the code
- Implementation of a simple stack data structure and related unit test to provide a sample project for using GitHub actions and CI.
- We are using the built in python unittest package as well as PyTest for the initial testing framework
- Github Status Badges act as funcionality to show the Repositories workflow Status. Whether a paticular workflow is passing, failing or the statistics of the workflow.

- The code coverage badge shows the percentage of the source code that is covered by test suite in "test_stack.py":<br />
